# Project-3-AirDelay-Detections
## Setup and Installation
For this project, SFML will need to be downloaded and setup. The 
best way to do this in CLion on Windows is to follow the instructions outlined here: https://dev.to/danielmelendezz/how-to-get-smfl-to-work-on-windows-using-clion-2bef.
## Running the Project
Once SFML has been installed and properly setup, make sure the directories
match those seen in our cmake file. Now, the main executable should run properly 
and the SFML Window should pop up. To use our program, select the appropraite filters from
the dropdown menu, choose the sort you would like to run, and press "Apply Filter".
Now, you should see the top 10 results in the results section. Continue to modify your filter 
requests as many times as you like and examine the results.
